# Face-recognition-using-FaceNet
A Face Recognition ML model trained using FaceNet Architecture and KNN classifier

The model uses a random face recognition dataset from Kaggle. It is trained using FaceNet model from Keras.
Feature Extraction of the faces were done using the MTCNN model.
Calculation of similarity between different face embeddings is done using KNN classifier.

The libraries used in this model are:
Keras
Sklearn
CV2
OS
Tensorflow
Matplotlib.pyplot
Numpt
